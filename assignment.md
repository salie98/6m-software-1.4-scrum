## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each scenario:

Scenario 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

Scrum is definitely helpful to carry out and implement the IT infrastructure of the startup company at the shortest possible period by applying its three pillars.

In Scrum, there's TRANSPARENCY wherein the team can have direct realization of the project's status. Through daily stand-ups or daily scrum meeting, the team collaborates of the work done for the day, the task to do for the day and improvement or issues to resolve or need assistance. There's also Retrospective, Sprint Reviews that allows visibility for all team members on the progress of the project.

Collection of feedback, inspection and approval of the deliverables or finished modules by the product owner ensure that the project aligns with the business goals (INSPECTION pillars). This is where the product backlogs are inspected via a Scrum board which requirements/functionalities have been "Done", In-Progress, or in the next sprint.

Scrum's ADAPTATION pillar gives the team a better and quicker look for the changes and how to improve as soon as possible to minimize further issues or blockers.
